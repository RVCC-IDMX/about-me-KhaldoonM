                <p>I want to become a successful cybersecurity professional. I’m studying cybersecurity because I enjoy learning how to protect computers, networks, and data from hackers and online threats. My goal is to help people and companies stay safe on the internet.

                    I first became interested in cybersecurity when I learned how easily personal information can be stolen online. I remember reading about a big data breach at a company, and it made me want to understand how these attacks happen—and how to stop them. That experience helped me decide what I wanted to do in the future.
                    
                    To me, being successful means reaching my goals and doing something that matters. I want to be someone people can trust to solve problems and keep information safe. I know the world of cybersecurity changes quickly, so I’m ready to keep learning new things and improving my skills.
                    
                    I believe in working hard. Whether it’s doing a hands-on lab, studying for a test, or helping others, I always try my best. I know that with effort and determination, I can achieve my goals.
                    
                    One day, I hope to become a cybersecurity expert who makes a real difference by protecting others and making the internet a safer place.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies and Intrests:</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>I have a variety of hobbies and interests that keep me creative, curious, and motivated. One of my biggest passions is cars. I enjoy learning about different models, how engines work, and the latest automotive technologies. I also love watching car reviews and visiting auto shows when I can.

                    Video games are another interest of mine. I enjoy both playing and analyzing games for their design, strategy, and storytelling. Gaming helps me relax and also sharpens my problem-solving and teamwork skills, especially in multiplayer games.
                    
                    I’m also passionate about video editing and vlogging. I enjoy filming content, editing clips, and creating videos that tell a story or share an experience. It’s a fun way to express myself and connect with others online.
                    
                    Coding is a skill I’m actively developing. I like building small projects and exploring how different programming languages work. It’s rewarding to see a piece of code come to life.
                    
                    Lastly, I love traveling. Exploring new places, trying different foods, and meeting new people inspire me. Traveling also gives me great content for vlogging and teaches me about different cultures and perspectives.
                    
                    Together, these hobbies help me grow both personally and professionally while keeping life exciting and meaningful.<p>

            <h2>✨ Adding Style with Image Hover Effects</h2>

            <div>

                <p>Image hover effects are a popular design technique in modern web development that enhance user interaction by animating or changing an image when the mouse pointer hovers over it. These effects are purely visual but can significantly improve user engagement, communicate interactivity, and add a polished feel to a webpage.

                    With just a few lines of CSS, you can create hover effects that scale, rotate, blur, change opacity, add filters, or even reveal hidden text. These effects are responsive and lightweight, making them perfect for everything from portfolio galleries to e-commerce product listings.Hover effects are applied using the :hover pseudo-class in CSS. When a user hovers over an image or container element, the browser applies the specified style changes.

                    Here’s a simple example where an image zooms in and fades slightly when hovered over:
                    
                    
                   </p>
